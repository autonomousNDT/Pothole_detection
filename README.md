# Pothole_detection


Pavement crack is the main form of early diseases of pavement. The use of digital photography to record pavement images and subsequent crack detection and classification has undergone continuous improvements over the past decade. Digital image processing has been applied to detect the pavement crack for its advantages of large amount of information and auto detection. The application of digital image processing was reviewed in pavement detection, pavement distresses classification and evaluation. This study aims at developing a robotic carrier for non-destructive thermal investigation in the search of hidden defects or damages in the road or bridge pavement structure.
